# Linked Open Usable Data for Cultural Heritage
####  Perspectives on Community Practices and Semantic Interoperability

PhD Thesis supervised by: 
- Peter Fornaro (University of Basel)
- Walter Leimgruber (University of Basel)
- Robert Sanderson (Yale University)

<!-- I am doing my PhD in Digital Humanities on Linked Open Usable Data, with a focus on its (potential) use in the Humanities and the perspectives it could bring in terms of community practices and semantic interoperability. My research is grounded as part of the Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA) research project, which aims to develop a Citizen Science platform around three photographic collections of the Swiss Society for Folklore Studies (SSFS).  -->

## IIIF

---

## Practices

- Asking the IIIF community or other participants often goes hand in hand with using the **IIIF Slack** for help and discussion.
- Consulting the **IIIF website** and referring to documentation, **GitHub** or specific tools are common practices.
- Collaborating with experts within their organisation is often mentioned alongside seeking help from developers.



<!-- 

Participants frequently uses a combination of tools, such as image viewers (Mirador, UV), validators, documentation resources, and community platforms (Slack, GitHub). The IIIF specifications website, IIIF Awesome, and various training materials were also mentioned as valuable resources. The range of tools and services mentioned reflects the diverse needs and interests of the IIIF community. Also it marks all the dependecies.

## Enablers

:white_check_mark: Inclusive and collaborative nature
:white_check_mark: Interoperable APIs and compatible implementations
:white_check_mark: Openness and friendliness
:white_check_mark: Commitment to providing resources and addressing needs

<!-- 

- The IIIF community's success stems from its inclusive and collaborative nature, the availability of interoperable APIs and compatible implementations, its openness and friendliness, and its commitment to providing resources and addressing specific needs.
- participants praised the IIIF community for its welcoming and generous attitude, successful implementation of the standard, and effective management structure.

## Inhibitors

:no_entry: Time constraints for participants
:no_entry: Technical complexity and learning curve
:no_entry: High costs of in-person meetings
:no_entry: Lack of employer support and recognition of community work


<!-- 

Time constraints emerged as the primary barrier, with some participants (11) expressing a lack of time to engage more actively. The technical nature of IIIF was also mentioned as a barrier, with some individuals finding it challenging to grasp the terminology and complexities quickly. Limited technical knowledge and the steep learning curve were cited as additional obstacles to entry (6). Some participants highlighted the importance of in-person meetings for community building and specification development but noted the high costs associated with organising and attending such events (2). Lack of support from employers beyond a certain point and the perception of community work as separate from job responsibilities were mentioned as barriers to deeper involvement (3).

Suggestions for improvement included better communication, emphasis on accessibility, and simpler implementation methods.
- Multiple dependencies

## Situating IIIF and Linked Art

---


## IIIF and Linked Art

- Both communities prioritise usable linked data (LOUD) by emphasising open API adoption.
- Common individuals play important roles in both initiatives.
- They collaborate on standards, development and meetings, fostering a culture of community-led work and shared knowledge.
- IIIF has expanded into various domains, while Linked Art remains focused on art-related objects for a smaller audience.

<!-- 

Based on the responses from 52 participants, it is evident that IIIF is recognised as a valuable tool in various contexts. A majority of participants (33) agree or strongly agree that IIIF is essential to Open Science, helps with Citizen Science initiatives (39), and contributes to the findability (45), accessibility (37), and reusability (47) aspects of the FAIR
principles. While the number of participants is significant, further exploration is needed to fully understand the extent of IIIF’s alignment with the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance
