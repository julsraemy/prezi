# Definitions

## Open(ness)

> Open means anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share for any purpose (subject, at most, to requirements that preserve provenance and openness)

The Open Definition according to the Open Knowledge Network: https://opendefinition.org/

---

# Definitions

## Open(ness)

- No limitations on access of any kind
- No cost, no authentication, no national or institutional privileges

&rarr; Knowledge funded by (i.e. produced under a mandate from) the public must benefit the public without any limitations

[Chen & Floridi 2013]

---

# Definitions

## Data

> Data at its most basic level as the absence of uniformity, whether in the real world or in some symbolic system. Only once such data have some recognisable structure and are given some meaning can they be considered information.

[Floridi 2010]


---

# Definitions

## Metadata

> Data whose purpose is to describe and give information about other data.

[Oxford English Dictionary 2023b]

### (Meta)data: semantic transposition

> (...) there is no fixed boundary between “data” and “metadata”, and that information viewed as data in one discipline may be metadata in another.  

[Alter et al. 2023]

# Definitions

## Open Data

> Open data and content can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose.

# History

## Robert K. Merton (1910-2003)

American sociologist, considered a founding father of modern sociology, said in 1942:

> Each researcher must contribute to the 'common pot' and give up intellectual property rights to allow knowledge to move forward.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_open-access_movement

> While the term “open data” isn’t even 20 years old, the author puts the concept in a historical context; the idea that scientific research should be free to all was popularized by Robert King Merton in the early 1940s. Research (which produces data) should be shared freely for the common good.

https://data.gov/blog/open-data-history/

---

# History

## Timeline 

- 1942: The concept starts with Robert K. Merton
- 1995: The term 'Open Data' first appeared, related to the sharing of geophysical and environmental data.
- November 2005: Open Knowledge Foundation creates the Open Definition
- December 2007: The concept of open public data was discussed and defined in Sebastopol, CA, USA at a meeting of Internet activists. They identified 8 principles.
- February 2009: Tim Berners-Lee presents [The next web](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_berners_lee_the_next_web) at TED2009. He famously asked for "raw data now".

https://devopedia.org/open-data
https://www.opendatasoft.com/en/what-is-open-data-practical-guide/

<!-- 

"In December 2007, thirty thinkers and activists of the Internet held a meeting in Sebastopol, north of San Francisco. Their aim was to define the concept of open public data and have it adopted by the US presidential candidates.

Among them, were two well-known figures: Tim O’Reilly and Lawrence Lessig. The first is familiar to the techies: this American author and editor is the originator of many vanguard computer and Internet movements; he defined and popularized expressions such as the open source and Web 2.0. Lawrence Lessig, Professor of Law at Stanford University (California), is the founder of Creative Commons licenses, based on the idea of copyleft and free dissemination of knowledge.

Participants of the Sebastopol meeting mostly come from the free software and culture movements. These movements are at the heart of many innovations in the field of computers and the Internet over the last fifteen years. Some of these innovations are now familiar – think of the collaborative encyclopedia Wikipedia. Other open source creations are less known to the general public despite playing a fundamental role in online services: for instance, the Apache software for the servers is used to host most websites.

Some activists and entrepreneurs who already used public data were attending the Sebastopol meeting too: Adrian Holovaty (the founder of EveryBlock, a localized information service) and Briton Tom Steinberg (initiator of the FixMyStreet site). One of the youngest of the group was no other than the late Aaron Swartz, inventor of the RSS and free knowledge activist. Together, they created the principles that allow us today to define and evaluate open public data."

# Open Research Data (ORD)

> Research data are the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital, or physical). These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Data may be raw or primary (e.g. direct from measurement or collection) or derived from primary data for subsequent analysis or interpretation (e.g. cleaned up or as an extract from a larger data set), or derived from existing sources where the rights may be held by others. 

[Concordat Working Group 2016]

---

# ORD

## For funding agencies (and institutions)

3. For the purposes of research assessment, consider the value and impact of all research outputs (**including datasets** and software) in addition to research publications, and consider a broad range of impact measures including qualitative indicators of research impact, such as influence on policy and practice.

## For organizations that supply metrics

11. Be open and transparent by providing data and methods used to calculate all metrics.
12. Provide the data under a licence that allows unrestricted reuse, and provide computational access to data, where possible.

San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA): https://sfdora.org/read/

# ORD in Switzerland

## SNSF Policy

The Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) expects all its funded researchers:

- to store the research data they have worked on and produced during the course of their research work,
- to share these data with other researchers, unless they are bound by legal, ethical, copyright, confidentiality or other clauses, and
- to deposit their data and metadata onto existing public repositories in formats that anyone can find, access and reuse without restriction.

https://www.snf.ch/en/dMILj9t4LNk8NwyR/topic/open-research-data

---

# ORD in Switzerland

## Vision

> By facilitating access to and reuse of research data, ORD promotes better, more effective, and more impactful research for the benefit of society as a whole. Through the principles of open access and reusability of research data, ORD practices support transparent and reproducible research findings. Moreover, ORD fosters collaboration by promoting exchange among researchers across disciplines, legal systems and national borders, thus enabling creativity and innovation to thrive.  

[Open Science Delegation 2021a]

# ORD in Switzerland

## Action Areas 

- Support researchers and research communities in imagining and adopting ORD practices
- Development, promotion, and maintenance of financially sustainable basic infrastructures and services for all researchers 
- Equipping researchers for ORD skills development and exchange of best practices
- Building up systemic und supportive conditions for institutions and research communities 

[Open Science Delegation 2021b]

# Research Data Management (RDM)

## Definition

RDM refers to the organisation, storage and preservation of data created during a research project.

## Purpose

RDM ensures that research data are well-organised, maintained and accessible for current and future research, thereby improving their reliability, validity and reproducibility.



---

# Data Management Plan (DMP)

## Definition

A DMP is a formal document that outlines how data will be handled during and after a research project, covering aspects from collection to sharing and preservation.

## Purpose

It serves as a guide for managing data efficiently and meets funding agency requirements for data stewardship. It is now mandatory for most funding agencies to require a DMP as part of the grant application process to secure funding. University libraries often have services and resources to assist researchers in creating these documents, providing expert guidance on best practices in data management.


---

# RDM and DMP

## Interconnected Roles

RDM encompasses the day-to-day management of research data, while a DMP provides a structured plan for how to manage, share, and preserve data throughout the research project.

## Planning and Execution

A DMP is essentially a blueprint for RDM. It outlines the policies and standards to be applied to the data, ensuring that data management practices are thought through from the outset of the project.


---

# Open Government Data (OGD)

> The work of government involves collecting huge amounts of data, much of which is not confidential (economic data, demographic data, spending data, crime data, transport data, etc). The value of much of this data can be greatly enhanced by releasing it as open data, freeing it for re-use by business, research, civil society, data journalists, etc.

# Licences 

## Copyright and Copyleft

### Copyright
- Grants creators exclusive rights to control use, reproduction, and distribution.
- Designed to protect creators' economic interests; allows monetization of work.

### Copyleft
- Allows use, modification, and distribution with the condition of keeping works and derivatives open.
- Promotes freedom, sharing of knowledge, and collaborative improvement.

For further information about licences &rarr; Competence Center in Digital Law: https://www.ccdigitallaw.ch/ 

<!-- 
Ownership and Control:

Copyright grants the creator exclusive rights over their work, including the right to control how it's used, reproduced, and distributed. Others must obtain permission from the copyright holder to use the work, often requiring payment or adherence to specific conditions.
Copyleft, on the other hand, is a concept in the realm of free and open-source software. It allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute the work, but with the stipulation that any derivative work must also be distributed under the same or compatible license terms. This ensures that the work and its derivatives remain free and open.
Purpose and Philosophy:

Copyright is designed to protect the economic interests of creators by granting them exclusive rights to monetize their work. It supports the traditional model of intellectual property rights.
Copyleft is motivated by the idea of promoting freedom and sharing of knowledge. It is intended to keep creative works accessible and reusable for the public, encouraging collaborative improvement and innovation.

# Licences

## Anglo-Saxon Copyright vs. European Author's Rights

### Anglo-Saxon Copyright
- Focuses on economic rights; treats copyright as transferable property.
- Duration based on set years post-creation or author's life plus years.

### European Author's Rights (_droit d'auteur / Urheberrecht_)
- Emphasises moral rights alongside economic rights.
- Grants inalienable moral rights to creators; duration includes lifetime plus post-death period (commonly 70 years).

<!-- 
Focus and Foundation:

The Anglo-Saxon copyright system (common in countries like the U.S. and the U.K.) is largely focused on the economic rights of authors. It treats copyright as a type of property that can be bought, sold, or transferred, and emphasizes the monetary value of creative works.
The European author's rights model places a stronger emphasis on the moral rights of the creator, alongside the economic rights. This includes the right to be recognized as the author of a work and to object to any distortion or modification that could harm the author's reputation.
Duration and Transferability:

In the Anglo-Saxon system, copyright is often seen as a more transferable and commercial asset. The duration of copyright is typically based on a set number of years post-creation or the author's life plus a certain number of years.
The European model tends to grant authors inalienable moral rights that remain with the creator regardless of the economic rights being sold or transferred. The duration can also vary, but it usually includes the author's lifetime plus a period after their death (commonly 70 years in many European countries).

Responsible AI Licenses (RAIL) are a class of licenses designed to encourage the responsible use of an AI artifact being licensed by including a set of use restrictions applied to AI artifact. RAILs can be more or less restrictive depending on the aims of the licensor. For instance, a license can be RAIL while being a proprietary license, or a license just allowing the use of the AI feature for research purposes and without allowing distribution of derivative versions. 

In contrast, Open & Responsible AI Licenses (OpenRAIL) are a subclass of RAIL licenses that permit free-of-charge open access and re-use of AI artifacts for commercial purposes, while including usage restrictions. Note that usage restrictions in RAIL Licenses also apply to any derivatives of AI artifact. 

RAILs can be used to license data (D), Apps (A), models (M), and source code (S). depending on the AI feature(s) you are licensing, you will add suffix D, A, M, or S

# Technical means

## Important factors in providing structured data for machines

- Data(set) formats
    - Text-based formats
    - Binary-encoded formats
- Metadata standards / schemas (to describe the dataset)
- Documentation
- Protocols

And of course the underlying infrastructure...

# Infrastructure

## Definitions

> A collective term for the subordinate parts of an undertaking; substructure, foundation.

[Oxford English Dictionary 2023a]

> People commonly envision infrastructure as a system of substrates – railroad, lines, pipes and plumbing, electrical power plants, and wires. **It is by definition invisible, part of the background for other kinds of work**. It is ready-to-hand. This image holds up well enough for many purposes – turn on the faucet for a drink of water and you use a vast infrastructure of plumbing and water regulation without usually thinking much about it.

[Star 1999]

<!-- 
Definition of an infrastructure according to Susan Leigh Star

# Infrastructure

## Dimensions

1. Embeddedness
2. Transparency
3. Reach or scope
4. Learned as part of membership
5. Links with conventions of practice

<!-- 

Thee of the nine dimensions...

Embeddedness: Infrastructure is sunk into and inside of other structures, social arrangements, and technologies. People do not necessarily distinguish the several coordinated aspects of infrastructure.

Links with conventions of practice: Infrastructure both shapes and is shaped by the conventions of a community of practice.

Embodiment of standards: Modified by scope and often by conflicting conventions, infrastructure takes on transparency by plugging into other infrastructures and tools in a standardised fashion.


 -->

# Infrastructure

## Dimensions

6. Embodiment of standards
7. Built on an installed base
8. Becomes visible upon breakdown
9. Is fixed in modular increments
10. Not all at once globally

[Star 1999]

# e-periodica OAI-PMH - Ethnology and Folklore
This script was done to download the metadata of [e-periodica](https://www.e-periodica.ch/) through 
their OAI-PMH endpoint (`https://www.e-periodica.ch/oai`) that could be interesting to the PIA research 
project as we want to link our image-based collections to the e-periodica articles. 

There are more than 16k metadata articles which have 
the 390 `setSpec` (Ethnology, folklore) on e-periodica. Probably, the more relevant articles 
come from the `Korrespondenzblättern der SGV` (more than 2k articles), divided into these three sources: 

- https://www.e-periodica.ch/digbib/volumes?UID=sgv-001 
- https://www.e-periodica.ch/digbib/volumes?UID=sgv-002

# Metadata standards / schemas

- **Metadata standards** are sets of rules and guidelines that dictate how metadata should be formatted and used. They ensure consistency and interoperability across different systems and platforms.
  - CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC-CRM), Dublin Core, Machine-Readable Cataloging (MARC), Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies (PREMIS)
- **Metadata schemas** are specific implementations of metadata standards. They outline the structure, elements, and attributes of metadata for a specific purpose.
  - Encoded Archival Description (EAD), Lightweight Information Describing Object (LIDO), Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS)

<!-- 

While standards provide the "what" and "why" of metadata, schemas offer the "how" for specific data types or field needs.

# DCAT

## Seven classes ("entities")

1. `dcat:Catalog` represents a catalogue, which is a dataset in which each individual item is a metadata record describing some resource
2. `dcat:Resource` represents a dataset, a data service or any other resource that may be described by a metadata record in a catalogue.
3. `dcat:Dataset` represents a collection of data, published or curated by a single agent or identifiable community. 
4. `dcat:Distribution` represents an accessible form of a dataset such as a downloadable file.


---

5. `dcat:DataService` represents a collection of operations accessible through an interface (API) that provide access to one or more datasets or data processing functions.
6. `dcat:DatasetSeries` is a dataset that represents a collection of datasets that are published separately, but share some characteristics that group them.
7. `dcat:CatalogRecord` represents a metadata record in the catalogue, primarily concerning the registration information, such as who added the record and when.

# Documentation

Comprehensive and understandable information about the data, including its source, structure, context, and how to use it effectively.

## Types of Documentation 

- Data field descriptions/data models
- User guides
- Metadata
- Developer documentation
- Source code documentation

<!-- 

Enhances Usability: Makes data more accessible and understandable to a wider audience, including non-experts and developers.
Facilitates Data Quality and Trust: Offers transparency about the data’s sources, methodologies, and underlying code, building trust among users.
Supports Data Integration and Development: Helps in combining data from different sources and in the development of applications using the open data.

 -->

---

# Protocols

- **Application Programming Interface (API)**: mechanism that enable two software components to communicate with each other
  - **Representational State Transfer (REST)**: a style of API that uses HTTP requests for communication. REST is stateless, _i.e. each request from a client to the server is treated as new. There is no stored memory of previous interactions. This means the server does not store any state about the client session on the server side_.
  - **Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)**: a protocol used for exchanging structured information in web services, offering high security and transactional reliability. SOAP can support both stateless and stateful operations.
- **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**: used for the transfer of data files, particularly large datasets, from one host to another.

<!-- 
Set of rules and standards that govern the exchange and accessibility of open data through the internet.

Enables Accessibility: Facilitates easy and standardized access to open data, essential for fostering innovation and transparency.
Supports Interoperability: Ensures that open data from various sources can be integrated and used together efficiently.

 -->

---

# Protocols

- **Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)**: a protocol for harvesting metadata descriptions of records in an archive, particularly used in digital libraries.
- **Really Simple Syndication or Rich Site Summary (RSS) / Atom Feeds**: used for regularly updating or publishing data that changes frequently. Feeds enable publishers to syndicate data automatically.
- **SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL)**: used for querying and manipulating RDF

# Open Access

## Definition 

> **Open access (OA) is a broad international movement that seeks to grant free and open online access to academic information**, such as publications and data. A publication is defined 'open access' when there are no financial, legal or technical barriers to accessing it - that is to say when anyone can read, download, copy, distribute, print, search for and search within the information, or use it in education or in any other way within the legal agreements.

# Open Access

## Definition 

> OA is a publishing model for scholarly communication that makes research information available to readers at no cost, as opposed to the traditional subscription model in which readers have access to scholarly information by paying a subscription (usually via libraries). 



https://www.openaccess.nl/en/what-is-open-access


<!-- 
In a nutshell, OA refers to the practice of providing unrestricted access via the Internet to peer-reviewed scholarly research.

 -->


---

# Open Access

## Gold Open Access

Publications are made freely accessible by the publisher immediately upon publication. It often involves Article Processing Charges (APCs) paid by the author, their institution, or a funder.

&rarr; Immediate OA via publisher

## Green Open Access (Self-Archiving)

Authors publish their work in any journal and then self-archive an earlier version of the article (pre-print) for free public use in a repository (sometimes after an embargo period).

&rarr; Immediate or delayed OA via self-archiving method/repository

---

# Open Access

## Hybrid Open Access

Subscription-based journals allow authors to make their individual articles OA upon payment of an APC.

&rarr; Immediate OA via publisher

## Diamond/Platinum Open Access

Journals do not charge authors APCs and provide immediate OA to all their articles. It operates without direct cost to the authors; funding often comes from institutions, societies, or donations.

&rarr; Immediate OA via publisher

---

# Open Access

## Bronze Open Access

Articles made freely accessible on the publisher's website without an explicit OA licence.

## Blue Open Access

Through blue OA, authors can archive the post-print or the publisher’s final version.

## Black Open Access

It refers to the unauthorised distribution of published content through various channels, such as pirate sites or peer-to-peer networks.



---

# Open Science

## Definition

> Open Science is the practice of science in such a way that others can collaborate and contribute, where research data, lab notes and other research processes are freely available, under terms that enable reuse, redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data and methods.

[FOSTER 2019]

# Free Software

- Free Software is centred around the idea of user freedom – the freedom to run, study, change, and distribute the software. "Free" refers to freedom, not price.
- It has **four essential freedoms**
  - The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
  - The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
  - The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
  - The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

<!-- 

It emphasises users' rights and community benefits, going beyond mere practical advantages. Key projects include the GNU Operating System and Free Software Directory.

 -->  

---

# Free Software

> “Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer.” We sometimes call it “libre software,” borrowing the French or Spanish word for “free” as in freedom, to show we do not mean the software is gratis.

# F(L)OSS

## Free/Libre and Open Source Software

> This is software for which the licensee can get the source code, and is allowed to modify this code and to redistribute the software and the modifications. Many terms are used: free, referring to the freedom to use (not to “free of charge”), libre, which is the French translation of Free/freedom, and which is preferred by some writers to avoid the ambiguous reference to free of charge, and open source, which focuses more on the access to the sources than on the freedom to redistribute. In practice, the differences are not great, and more and more scholars are choosing the term FLOSS to name this whole movement.

[Jullien 2009]

"Neutral stance": See https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html

<!-- 
FLOSS merges the social and ethical emphasis of Free Software with the pragmatic model of Open Source.

# FAIR 

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/FAIR_data_principles.jpg)

FAIR Data Principles: https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/

[Wilkinson et al. 2016]

<!-- 
Data oriented principles
 -->

---

# FAIR

## Findable

F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier

F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1)

F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe

F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource

---

# FAIR

## Accessible

A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol

- A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable

- A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary

A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

---

# FAIR

## Interoperable

I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.

I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles

I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

---

# FAIR

## Reusable

R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes

- R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license

- R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance

- R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards

CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance: https://www.gida-global.org/care

[Carroll et al. 2020]

<!-- 
Indigenous data sovereignty reinforces the rights to engage in decision-making in accordance with Indigenous values and collective interests. 

 -->

---

# CARE

## Collective Benefit

C1. For inclusive development and innovation

C2. For improved governance and citizen engagement

C3. For equitable outcomes

<!-- 
Data ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit from the data.
 -->

---

# CARE

## Authority to Control

A1. Recognizing rights and interests 

A2. Data for governance

A3. Governance of data

<!-- 
Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests in Indigenous data must be recognised and their authority to control such data be empowered. Indigenous data governance enables Indigenous Peoples and governing bodies to determine how Indigenous Peoples, as well as Indigenous lands, territories, resources, knowledges and geographical indicators, are represented and identified within data.

 -->


---

# CARE

## Responsibility

R1. For positive relationships

R2. For expanding capability and capacity

R3. For Indigenous languages and worldviews


<!-- 
Those working with Indigenous data have a responsibility to share how those data are used to support Indigenous Peoples’ selfdetermination and collective benefit. Accountability requires meaningful and openly available evidence of these efforts and the benefits accruing to Indigenous Peoples.

 -->

---

# CARE

## Ethics

E1. For minimizing harm and maximizing benefit

E2. For justice

E3. For future use

<!-- 
Indigenous Peoples’ rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern at all stages of the data life cycle and across the data ecosystem.
 -->

# CARE and FAIR

## Operationalising CARE and FAIR

![](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41597-021-00892-0/MediaObjects/41597_2021_892_Fig2_HTML.png)

[Carroll et al. 2021]

<!-- 

FAIR and CARE are complementary perspectives which enable maximum value through the appropriate and ethical reuse of Indigenous data. However, assessing the FAIR-ness of a data set is typically a technical exercise which can be done independently by the researcher to prepare the final data set for reuse. On the other hand, the CARE Principles require engagement with people to address the cultural, ethical, legal, and social dimensions associated with the intended uses of the dataset. As Indigenous communities expect CARE-full data practices to be enacted at each step of the data lifecycle, we will need to reflect a broader temporal dimension to our application of the CARE Principles. At present there is no process to assess whether a research project meets the CARE Principles. Creating such an assessment represents the next stage towards an equitable cyberinfrastructure that supports the FAIR and CARE-full use of Indigenous data.

# Collections as Data 

## 10 Principles

1. Collections as Data development aims to encourage computational use of digitised and born digital collections.
2. Collections as Data stewards are guided by ongoing ethical commitments.
3. Collections as Data stewards aim to lower barriers to use.
4. Collections as Data designed for everyone serve no one.
5. Shared documentation helps others find a path to doing the work. 
6. Collections as Data should be made openly accessible by default, except in cases where ethical or legal obligations preclude it.

# Collections as Data 

7. Collections as Data development values interoperability.
8. Collections as Data stewards work transparently in order to develop trustworthy, long-lived collections.
9. Data as well as the data that describe those data are considered in scope. 
10. The development of collections as data is an ongoing process and does not necessarily conclude with a final version.

# Collections as Data 

## Checklist to publish Collections as Data in GLAM institutions

1. Provide a clear license allowing reuse of the dataset without restrictions 
2. Provide a suggestion of how to cite your dataset 
3. Include documentation about the dataset 
4. Use a public platform to publish the dataset 
5. Share examples of use as additional documentation 
6. Give structure to the dataset 

_Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums (GLAM)_

<!-- 

Purpose The purpose of this study is to offer a checklist that can be used for both creating and evaluating digital collections, which are also sometimes referred to as data sets as part of the collections as data movement, suitable for computational use. Design/methodology/approach The checklist was built by synthesising and analysing the results of relevant research literature, articles and studies and the issues and needs obtained in an observational study. The checklist was tested and applied both as a tool for assessing a selection of digital collections made available by galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM) institutions as proof of concept and as a supporting tool for creating collections as data. Findings Over the past few years, there has been a growing interest in making available digital collections published by GLAM organisations for computational use. Based on previous work, the authors defined a methodology to build a checklist for the publication of Collections as data. The authors’ evaluation showed several examples of applications that can be useful to encourage other institutions to publish their digital collections for computational use. Originality/value While some work on making available digital collections suitable for computational use exists, giving particular attention to data quality, planning and experimentation, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, none of the work to date provides an easy-to-follow and robust checklist to publish collection data sets in GLAM institutions. This checklist intends to encourage small- and medium-sized institutions to adopt the collections as data principles in daily workflows following best practices and guidelines.

# An Open Vision of the Web

> The [World Wide Web] project merges the techniques of information retrieval and hypertext to make an easy but powerful global information system. The project started with **the philosophy that much academic information should be freely available to anyone**.

[Berners-Lee 1991]

---

# Linked Data

Linked Data refers to a set of best practices for publishing structured data on the Web.

## Linked Data Principles

- Use Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) as names for things
- Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.
- When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (e.g. RDF, RDFS, SPARQL, etc.)
- Include links to other URIs so that they can discover more things.

[Berners-Lee 2006]

<!-- 
Linked Data refers to a method of publishing structured data so that it can be interlinked and become more useful through semantic queries. It builds upon standard Web technologies such as HTTP, RDF, and URIs, but rather than using them to serve web pages for human readers, it extends them to share information in a way that can be read automatically by computers. This enables data from different sources to be connected and queried.
 -->

---

# Linked Open Data (LOD)

![center](https://5stardata.info/images/5-star-steps.png)

5-star deployment scheme for Open Data: https://5stardata.info/

<!-- 

Linked Open Data is a subset of Linked Data that is open, meaning it is freely accessible and reusable by anyone. It adheres to the principles of being accessible under an open license, available in a machine-readable format, using open standards from the W3C (such as RDF and SPARQL), and linked to other datasets to increase its utility.
 -->

---

# The Semantic Web or _the Web of Data_

The Semantic Web is an extension of the World Wide Web, through standards, to make it machine-readable.

![center width:530px](https://julsraemy.ch/prezi/assets/tweaked-semweb-layer-cake.webp)

Tweaked Semantic Web Layer Cake [Idehen 2017]

<!-- This Web, which has claimed to be a Semantic Web for several years now, has a centrepiece known as Resource Description Framework (RDF), a general method for describing and exchanging graph data. The Semantic Web offers major opportunities for scholarship as it allows data to be reasoned together, that is to be understood by machines via those RDF-based ontologies, a formal way to represent human-like knowledge.  -->

---


#  Resource Description Framework (RDF)

With RDF, everything goes in threes. Most of the triples' components have Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). Syntax: **subject, predicate, object** $(s \ \vec{p} \ o)$ 

![center width:590px](https://julsraemy.ch/prezi/assets/rdf-graph.svg)


<!-- With RDF, everything goes in threes, the data model contains so-called triples: that is subject, predicate, object that form graphs.
Most of the components of these triples use Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) and are generally web-addressable, whether for naming subjects and objects (which may themselves also be objects of other triples) or relationships 

 -->

---

# Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD)

The concept of LOUD extends LOD by emphasising not just the openness and interlinking of data but also its usability. 

## LOUD

- The term was coined by Robert Sanderson [2018, 2019] who has been involved in the conception and maintenance of web standards, mainly in the cultural heritage field. 
- LOUD's goal is to achieve the Semantic Web's intent on a global scale in a usable fashion by leveraging community-driven and JSON-LD-based specifications.
- It has five main design principles to make the data more easily accessible to software developers, who play a key role in interacting with the data and building software and services on top of it, and to some extent to academics. 

---

# Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD)

## LOUD design principles

- The right Abstraction for the audience
- Few Barriers to entry
- Comprehensible by introspection
- Documentation with working examples
- Few Exceptions, instead many consistent patterns

# International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) 

## IIIF

- A model for presenting and annotating content
- A global community that develops shared application programming interfaces (APIs), implements them in software, and exposes interoperable content

https://iiif.io

<!-- IIIF is a community-driven initiative, which brings together key players in the academic and CH fields, and has defined open and shared APIs to standardise the way in which image-based resources are delivered on the Web. Implementing the IIIF APIs enables institutions to make better use of their digitised or born-digital material by providing, for instance, deep zooming, comparison, full-text search of OCR objects or annotation capabilities.  -->

## <!-- fit --> Images are fundamental carriers of information

<!-- So why do we need IIIF? Digital images are fundamental carriers of information across the fields of cultural heritage, STEM, and others. They help us understand complex processes through visualization. They grab our attention and help us quickly understand abstract concepts. They help document many the past--and the  present--and preserve it for the future. They are also ubiquitous: we interact with thousands of them every day both in real life and on the web. In short, images are important and we interact with large volumes of them online.

# LOUD-Driven Infrastructure

![center w:1000](https://julsraemy.ch/prezi/assets/loud-infra-example.jpg)

[Felsing et al. 2023]

---

# Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD)

## LOUD in a nutshell

- Grassroots development of IIIF and Linked Art with collaboration and transparency are one of the key factors, but implementations are needed to be conducted in parallel (specifications versus demonstrability).

- LOUD standards, when used in conjunction, enhances semantic interoperability, even if it comes at the cost of ontological purity.

- LOUD practices and standards should serve as common denominators for cultural heritage institutions, public bodies as well as research projects.

## Techniques, Software, and Tools

How to get and work with data?

---

<!-- footer: Techniques, Software, and Tools  -->

# Techniques

## Data Scraping

- Process of extracting data from websites or other online sources, typically using automated software or scripts. 
  - Advantages: It allows for efficient data collection from multiple sources, can automate repetitive tasks, and is capable of handling large volumes of data.
  - Challenges: Data scraping faces issues like website layout changes, legal and ethical considerations, as well as handling dynamic content loaded through JavaScript.
- Examples
  - Extracting exhibition data from museum websites using [Beautiful Soup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/), a Python library;
  - Scraping historical records or archives from government websites with [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/).

---

# Techniques

## API Integration

- API integration involves connecting and pulling data from external services.
  - Advantages: It provides structured and often real-time access to data, allows for automation, and ensures data consistency and reliability.
  - Challenges: Complexity in handling API limits/rate limiting, maintaining integration after API updates, and managing data from disparate APIs.
- Examples
  - Integrating social media data from platforms like Instagram, LinkedIn or Mastodon;
  - Retrieving weather information from meteorological APIs.

---

# Techniques

## Data Mining

- Data mining is the process of analysing large datasets to discover patterns, correlations, and insights.
  - Advantages: Helps in identifying trends, making predictions, and informing decision-making processes; can uncover hidden patterns in data.
  - Challenges: Requires significant computational resources, potential privacy concerns, and the need for skilled interpretation of results.
- Examples
  - Analysing visitor data patterns using [RapidMiner](https://altair.com/altair-rapidminer), a Java-based data science platform;
  - Mining public opinion data from government surveys with [WEKA](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/) (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis), a Java-based Machine Learning software.

---

# Techniques

## Data wrangling/munging

- Data wrangling, or munging, involves transforming and mapping raw data into a more structured and usable format.
  - Advantages: Makes data more accessible and useful for analysis, helps in cleaning and standardising data, and improves data quality.
  - Challenges: Time-consuming, requires expertise in data manipulation, and can be complex with large and diverse datasets.
- Examples 
  - Formatting and combining different datasets for a research project using Python's [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library;
  - Harmonising open government datasets from different departments for comparative analysis.

---

# Techniques

## Data Integration

# Conclusion

## Long-term archiving of ORD

* **Archival appraisal**: Identifying which research data warrants long-term preservation, taking into account scientific, historical or legal significance as data volumes increase.

* **Documentation and contextualisation**: Ensuring comprehensive documentation for each dataset, including the context of its creation, to maintain its relevance and intelligibility over time.

* **Infrastructure**: Addressing the challenges of physical and software obsolescence, file format changes and the risk of content loss over time.

* **Methodology/Process**: Determining the most effective time and method for archiving, including periodic or project completion, to prevent data loss and ensure data integrity.

---

# Conclusion

## Movements and principles impacting Open Data

* The rise of movements such as Open Access and Open Science, along with principles like FAIR and CARE, significantly shape the relevance and implementation of open data.

* However, achieving true openness requires not only adherence to these principles and movements but also the backing of sufficient funding and the cultivation of necessary skills among data practitioners. This is crucial for ensuring that open data is not just available but also meaningful and usable.

---

# Conclusion

## The Evolution of Open Data


* While open data in itself is a commendable goal, the concept of Linked Open (Usable) Data takes it a step further.

* Linked Open Data enhances the value of open data by ensuring it is not only available but also interconnected, making it more discoverable and useful for a wider range of applications and analyses.

* LOUD is about enhancing usability and semantic interoperability leveraging community-driven standards and practices.

---

# Conclusion

## OGD and ORD for GLAM institutions

* ORD and OGD can be viewed both as a service provided to the public and as a process that requires active management and continuous improvement.

* Institutions in the GLAM sector need to consider how these open data initiatives fit within their practices, both in terms of contributing data and utilising data for research, curation, and public engagement.


---

# Conclusion

## Public Engagement and Empowerment

* Open data empowers the public by providing access to information that was previously inaccessible or difficult to obtain.

* This not only fosters a more informed citizenry but also enables individuals and communities to participate more actively in civic and cultural discourses.

---

# Conclusion

## Transparency and Accountability

* Open data plays a pivotal role in enhancing transparency and accountability, particularly in sectors where public trust is paramount.

* By making data freely accessible, open data initiatives allow for greater scrutiny and analysis, leading to more accountable governance and institutional practices.

---

# Conclusion

## AI and ML

* Open data serves as a critical fuel for AI systems, providing the large datasets necessary for training ML models. The availability of diverse, high-quality open datasets enables more robust and inclusive AI developments.

* By leveraging open data, AI can transcend a wide array of domains, from improving healthcare diagnostics to enhancing climate change models, thus contributing significantly to societal advancements and problem-solving.

* Open data plays a pivotal role in fostering transparency and ethical practices in AI. By using open datasets, AI researchers and developers can ensure a level of accountability in their models, allowing for external validation and reducing biases.


---

# Conclusion

## Collaboration is Key

* Collaboration is a fundamental aspect of open data initiatives.
  * Discussing best practices grounded in collaboration, such as leveraging the Collections as Data checklist
  * Participating in the IIIF and Linked Art communities for the cultural heritage field (and beyond, notably for the STEM sector)
  * OGD meet-ups (Open Data Beer)
  * Etc.

* Such collaboration is vital for addressing global challenges, encouraging innovation, and ensuring the sustainable development of open data ecosystems.

<!-- 

In summary, open data is more than a concept; it's a dynamic ecosystem that thrives on principles, collaboration, and continuous evolution. Its impact spans from enhancing transparency to empowering public engagement, and its future hinges on effective funding, skill development, and collaborative efforts.

# _A multitude of tools_

![](https://youtu.be/pOX9CrvAG7I)

> For a better understanding of the past,
Our images have to be enhanced,
A new dialogue in three dimensions,
Must have openness at its heart,
For somewhere within the archive
Of our aggregated minds
Are a multitude of questions
And a multitude of answers,
Simply awaiting to be found.

[Mr Gee 2023], Data Poet at EuropeanaTech 2023
