# Definitions

## Open(ness)

> Open means anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share for any purpose (subject, at most, to requirements that preserve provenance and openness)

The Open Definition according to the Open Knowledge Network: https://opendefinition.org/

---

# Definitions

## Open(ness)

- No limitations on access of any kind
- No cost, no authentication, no national or institutional privileges

&rarr; Knowledge funded by (i.e. produced under a mandate from) the public must benefit the public without any limitations

# Definitions

## Data

> Data at its most basic level as the absence of uniformity, whether in the real world or in some symbolic system. Only once such data have some recognisable structure and are given some meaning can they be considered information.

[Floridi 2010]


---

# Definitions

## Metadata

> Data whose purpose is to describe and give information about other data.

[Oxford English Dictionary 2023]

### (Meta)data: semantic transposition

> (...) there is no fixed boundary between “data” and “metadata”, and that information viewed as data in one discipline may be metadata in another.  

[Alter et al. 2023]


---

# Definitions

## Open Data

> Open data and content can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose.

The Open Definition according to the Open Knowledge Network: https://opendefinition.org/

# History

## Robert K. Merton (1910-2003)

American sociologist, considered a founding father of modern sociology, said in 1942:

> Each researcher must contribute to the 'common pot' and give up intellectual property rights to allow knowledge to move forward.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_open-access_movement

> While the term “open data” isn’t even 20 years old, the author puts the concept in a historical context; the idea that scientific research should be free to all was popularized by Robert King Merton in the early 1940s. Research (which produces data) should be shared freely for the common good.

https://data.gov/blog/open-data-history/

---

# History

## Timeline 

- 1942: The concept starts with Robert K. Merton
- 1995: The term 'Open Data' first appeared, related to the sharing of geophysical and environmental data.
- November 2005: Open Knowledge Foundation creates the Open Definition
- December 2007: The concept of open public data was discussed and defined in Sebastopol, CA, USA at a meeting of Internet activists. They identified 8 principles.
- February 2009: Tim Berners-Lee presents [The next web](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_berners_lee_the_next_web) at TED2009. He famously asked for "raw data now".

https://devopedia.org/open-data
https://www.opendatasoft.com/en/what-is-open-data-practical-guide/

<!-- 

"In December 2007, thirty thinkers and activists of the Internet held a meeting in Sebastopol, north of San Francisco. Their aim was to define the concept of open public data and have it adopted by the US presidential candidates.

Among them, were two well-known figures: Tim O’Reilly and Lawrence Lessig. The first is familiar to the techies: this American author and editor is the originator of many vanguard computer and Internet movements; he defined and popularized expressions such as the open source and Web 2.0. Lawrence Lessig, Professor of Law at Stanford University (California), is the founder of Creative Commons licenses, based on the idea of copyleft and free dissemination of knowledge.

Participants of the Sebastopol meeting mostly come from the free software and culture movements. These movements are at the heart of many innovations in the field of computers and the Internet over the last fifteen years. Some of these innovations are now familiar – think of the collaborative encyclopedia Wikipedia. Other open source creations are less known to the general public despite playing a fundamental role in online services: for instance, the Apache software for the servers is used to host most websites.

Some activists and entrepreneurs who already used public data were attending the Sebastopol meeting too: Adrian Holovaty (the founder of EveryBlock, a localized information service) and Briton Tom Steinberg (initiator of the FixMyStreet site). One of the youngest of the group was no other than the late Aaron Swartz, inventor of the RSS and free knowledge activist. Together, they created the principles that allow us today to define and evaluate open public data."

# Open Research Data (ORD)

> Research data are the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital, or physical). These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Data may be raw or primary (e.g. direct from measurement or collection) or derived from primary data for subsequent analysis or interpretation (e.g. cleaned up or as an extract from a larger data set), or derived from existing sources where the rights may be held by others. 

[Concordat Working Group 2016]

---

# ORD

## For funding agencies (and institutions)

3. For the purposes of research assessment, consider the value and impact of all research outputs (**including datasets** and software) in addition to research publications, and consider a broad range of impact measures including qualitative indicators of research impact, such as influence on policy and practice.

## For organizations that supply metrics

11. Be open and transparent by providing data and methods used to calculate all metrics.
12. Provide the data under a licence that allows unrestricted reuse, and provide computational access to data, where possible.

San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA): https://sfdora.org/read/

# ORD in Switzerland

## SNSF Policy

The Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) expects all its funded researchers:

- to store the research data they have worked on and produced during the course of their research work,
- to share these data with other researchers, unless they are bound by legal, ethical, copyright, confidentiality or other clauses, and
- to deposit their data and metadata onto existing public repositories in formats that anyone can find, access and reuse without restriction.

https://www.snf.ch/en/dMILj9t4LNk8NwyR/topic/open-research-data

---

# ORD in Switzerland

## Vision

> By facilitating access to and reuse of research data, ORD promotes better, more effective, and more impactful research for the benefit of society as a whole. Through the principles of open access and reusability of research data, ORD practices support transparent and reproducible research findings. Moreover, ORD fosters collaboration by promoting exchange among researchers across disciplines, legal systems and national borders, thus enabling creativity and innovation to thrive.  

[Open Science Delegation 2021a]

---

# ORD in Switzerland

## Action Areas 

- Support researchers and research communities in imagining and adopting ORD practices
- Development, promotion, and maintenance of financially sustainable basic infrastructures and services for all researchers 
- Equipping researchers for ORD skills development and exchange of best practices
- Building up systemic und supportive conditions for institutions and research communities 

[Open Science Delegation 2021b]

# Open Government Data (OGD)

> The work of government involves collecting huge amounts of data, much of which is not confidential (economic data, demographic data, spending data, crime data, transport data, etc). The value of much of this data can be greatly enhanced by releasing it as open data, freeing it for re-use by business, research, civil society, data journalists, etc.

# Licences 

## Copyright and Copyleft

### Copyright
- Grants creators exclusive rights to control use, reproduction, and distribution.
- Designed to protect creators' economic interests; allows monetization of work.

### Copyleft
- Allows use, modification, and distribution with the condition of keeping works and derivatives open.
- Promotes freedom, sharing of knowledge, and collaborative improvement.

For further information about licences &rarr; Competence Center in Digital Law: https://www.ccdigitallaw.ch/ 

<!-- 
Ownership and Control:

Copyright grants the creator exclusive rights over their work, including the right to control how it's used, reproduced, and distributed. Others must obtain permission from the copyright holder to use the work, often requiring payment or adherence to specific conditions.
Copyleft, on the other hand, is a concept in the realm of free and open-source software. It allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute the work, but with the stipulation that any derivative work must also be distributed under the same or compatible license terms. This ensures that the work and its derivatives remain free and open.
Purpose and Philosophy:

Copyright is designed to protect the economic interests of creators by granting them exclusive rights to monetize their work. It supports the traditional model of intellectual property rights.
Copyleft is motivated by the idea of promoting freedom and sharing of knowledge. It is intended to keep creative works accessible and reusable for the public, encouraging collaborative improvement and innovation.

# Licences

## Anglo-Saxon Copyright vs. European Author's Rights

### Anglo-Saxon Copyright
- Focuses on economic rights; treats copyright as transferable property.
- Duration based on set years post-creation or author's life plus years.

### European Author's Rights (_droit d'auteur / Urheberrecht_)
- Emphasises moral rights alongside economic rights.
- Grants inalienable moral rights to creators; duration includes lifetime plus post-death period (commonly 70 years).

<!-- 
Focus and Foundation:

The Anglo-Saxon copyright system (common in countries like the U.S. and the U.K.) is largely focused on the economic rights of authors. It treats copyright as a type of property that can be bought, sold, or transferred, and emphasizes the monetary value of creative works.
The European author's rights model places a stronger emphasis on the moral rights of the creator, alongside the economic rights. This includes the right to be recognized as the author of a work and to object to any distortion or modification that could harm the author's reputation.
Duration and Transferability:

In the Anglo-Saxon system, copyright is often seen as a more transferable and commercial asset. The duration of copyright is typically based on a set number of years post-creation or the author's life plus a certain number of years.
The European model tends to grant authors inalienable moral rights that remain with the creator regardless of the economic rights being sold or transferred. The duration can also vary, but it usually includes the author's lifetime plus a period after their death (commonly 70 years in many European countries).

<!-- 

Responsible AI Licenses (RAIL) are a class of licenses designed to encourage the responsible use of an AI artifact being licensed by including a set of use restrictions applied to AI artifact. RAILs can be more or less restrictive depending on the aims of the licensor. For instance, a license can be RAIL while being a proprietary license, or a license just allowing the use of the AI feature for research purposes and without allowing distribution of derivative versions. 

In contrast, Open & Responsible AI Licenses (OpenRAIL) are a subclass of RAIL licenses that permit free-of-charge open access and re-use of AI artifacts for commercial purposes, while including usage restrictions. Note that usage restrictions in RAIL Licenses also apply to any derivatives of AI artifact. 

RAILs can be used to license data (D), Apps (A), models (M), and source code (S). depending on the AI feature(s) you are licensing, you will add suffix D, A, M, or S

# Metadata standards / schemas

- **Metadata standards** are sets of rules and guidelines that dictate how metadata should be formatted and used. They ensure consistency and interoperability across different systems and platforms.
  - CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC-CRM), Dublin Core, Machine-Readable Cataloging (MARC), Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies (PREMIS)
- **Metadata schemas** are specific implementations of metadata standards. They outline the structure, elements, and attributes of metadata for a specific purpose.
  - Encoded Archival Description (EAD), Lightweight Information Describing Object (LIDO), Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS)

<!-- 

While standards provide the "what" and "why" of metadata, schemas offer the "how" for specific data types or field needs.

# DCAT

## Seven classes ("entities")

1. `dcat:Catalog` represents a catalogue, which is a dataset in which each individual item is a metadata record describing some resource
2. `dcat:Resource` represents a dataset, a data service or any other resource that may be described by a metadata record in a catalogue.
3. `dcat:Dataset` represents a collection of data, published or curated by a single agent or identifiable community. 
4. `dcat:Distribution` represents an accessible form of a dataset such as a downloadable file.


---

5. `dcat:DataService` represents a collection of operations accessible through an interface (API) that provide access to one or more datasets or data processing functions.
6. `dcat:DatasetSeries` is a dataset that represents a collection of datasets that are published separately, but share some characteristics that group them.
7. `dcat:CatalogRecord` represents a metadata record in the catalogue, primarily concerning the registration information, such as who added the record and when.

# Documentation

Comprehensive and understandable information about the data, including its source, structure, context, and how to use it effectively.

## Types of Documentation 

- Data field descriptions/data models
- User guides
- Metadata
- Developer documentation
- Source code documentation

<!-- 

Enhances Usability: Makes data more accessible and understandable to a wider audience, including non-experts and developers.
Facilitates Data Quality and Trust: Offers transparency about the data’s sources, methodologies, and underlying code, building trust among users.
Supports Data Integration and Development: Helps in combining data from different sources and in the development of applications using the open data.

 -->

---

# Protocols

- **Application Programming Interface (API)**: mechanism that enable two software components to communicate with each other
  - **Representational State Transfer (REST)**: a style of API that uses HTTP requests for communication. REST is stateless, _i.e. each request from a client to the server is treated as new. There is no stored memory of previous interactions. This means the server does not store any state about the client session on the server side_.
  - **Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)**: a protocol used for exchanging structured information in web services, offering high security and transactional reliability. SOAP can support both stateless and stateful operations.
- **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**: used for the transfer of data files, particularly large datasets, from one host to another.

<!-- 
Set of rules and standards that govern the exchange and accessibility of open data through the internet.

Enables Accessibility: Facilitates easy and standardized access to open data, essential for fostering innovation and transparency.
Supports Interoperability: Ensures that open data from various sources can be integrated and used together efficiently.

 -->

---

# Protocols

- **Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)**: a protocol for harvesting metadata descriptions of records in an archive, particularly used in digital libraries.
- **Really Simple Syndication or Rich Site Summary (RSS) / Atom Feeds**: used for regularly updating or publishing data that changes frequently. Feeds enable publishers to syndicate data automatically.
- **SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL)**: used for querying and manipulating RDF

# FAIR 

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/FAIR_data_principles.jpg)

FAIR Data Principles: https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/

[Wilkinson et al. 2016]

<!-- 
Data oriented principles
 -->

---

# FAIR

## Findable

F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier

F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1)

F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe

F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource

---

# FAIR

## Accessible

A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol

- A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable

- A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary

A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

---

# FAIR

## Interoperable

I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.

I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles

I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

---

# FAIR

## Reusable

R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes

- R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license

- R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance

- R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards

# CARE 

![center w:500px](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d3799de845604000199cd24/1567592451970-2R8XFL670QNMAGDRV7ED/Be+FAIR+and+CARE.png)

CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance: https://www.gida-global.org/care

[Carroll et al. 2020]

<!-- 
Indigenous data sovereignty reinforces the rights to engage in decision-making in accordance with Indigenous values and collective interests. 

 -->

---

# CARE

## Collective Benefit

C1. For inclusive development and innovation

C2. For improved governance and citizen engagement

C3. For equitable outcomes

<!-- 
Data ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit from the data.
 -->

---

# CARE

## Authority to Control

A1. Recognizing rights and interests 

A2. Data for governance

A3. Governance of data

<!-- 
Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests in Indigenous data must be recognised and their authority to control such data be empowered. Indigenous data governance enables Indigenous Peoples and governing bodies to determine how Indigenous Peoples, as well as Indigenous lands, territories, resources, knowledges and geographical indicators, are represented and identified within data.

 -->


---

# CARE

## Responsibility

R1. For positive relationships

R2. For expanding capability and capacity

R3. For Indigenous languages and worldviews


<!-- 
Those working with Indigenous data have a responsibility to share how those data are used to support Indigenous Peoples’ selfdetermination and collective benefit. Accountability requires meaningful and openly available evidence of these efforts and the benefits accruing to Indigenous Peoples.

 -->

---

# CARE

## Ethics

E1. For minimizing harm and maximizing benefit

E2. For justice

E3. For future use

<!-- 
Indigenous Peoples’ rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern at all stages of the data life cycle and across the data ecosystem.
 -->


---

# CARE and FAIR

## Operationalising CARE and FAIR

![](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41597-021-00892-0/MediaObjects/41597_2021_892_Fig2_HTML.png)

[Carroll et al. 2021]

<!-- 

FAIR and CARE are complementary perspectives which enable maximum value through the appropriate and ethical reuse of Indigenous data. However, assessing the FAIR-ness of a data set is typically a technical exercise which can be done independently by the researcher to prepare the final data set for reuse. On the other hand, the CARE Principles require engagement with people to address the cultural, ethical, legal, and social dimensions associated with the intended uses of the dataset. As Indigenous communities expect CARE-full data practices to be enacted at each step of the data lifecycle, we will need to reflect a broader temporal dimension to our application of the CARE Principles. At present there is no process to assess whether a research project meets the CARE Principles. Creating such an assessment represents the next stage towards an equitable cyberinfrastructure that supports the FAIR and CARE-full use of Indigenous data.

# Collections as Data 

## 10 Principles

1. Collections as Data development aims to encourage computational use of digitised and born digital collections.
2. Collections as Data stewards are guided by ongoing ethical commitments.
3. Collections as Data stewards aim to lower barriers to use.
4. Collections as Data designed for everyone serve no one.
5. Shared documentation helps others find a path to doing the work. 
6. Collections as Data should be made openly accessible by default, except in cases where ethical or legal obligations preclude it.

---

![bg 28% opacity:.1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/collectionsasdata/part2whole/master/_posts/cad_logo_matte.png)

# Collections as Data 

7. Collections as Data development values interoperability.
8. Collections as Data stewards work transparently in order to develop trustworthy, long-lived collections.
9. Data as well as the data that describe those data are considered in scope. 
10. The development of collections as data is an ongoing process and does not necessarily conclude with a final version.

# Collections as Data 

## Checklist to publish Collections as Data in GLAM institutions

1. Provide a clear license allowing reuse of the dataset without restrictions 
2. Provide a suggestion of how to cite your dataset 
3. Include documentation about the dataset 
4. Use a public platform to publish the dataset 
5. Share examples of use as additional documentation 
6. Give structure to the dataset 

_Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums (GLAM)_

<!-- 

Purpose The purpose of this study is to offer a checklist that can be used for both creating and evaluating digital collections, which are also sometimes referred to as data sets as part of the collections as data movement, suitable for computational use. Design/methodology/approach The checklist was built by synthesising and analysing the results of relevant research literature, articles and studies and the issues and needs obtained in an observational study. The checklist was tested and applied both as a tool for assessing a selection of digital collections made available by galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM) institutions as proof of concept and as a supporting tool for creating collections as data. Findings Over the past few years, there has been a growing interest in making available digital collections published by GLAM organisations for computational use. Based on previous work, the authors defined a methodology to build a checklist for the publication of Collections as data. The authors’ evaluation showed several examples of applications that can be useful to encourage other institutions to publish their digital collections for computational use. Originality/value While some work on making available digital collections suitable for computational use exists, giving particular attention to data quality, planning and experimentation, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, none of the work to date provides an easy-to-follow and robust checklist to publish collection data sets in GLAM institutions. This checklist intends to encourage small- and medium-sized institutions to adopt the collection as data principles in daily workflows following best practices and guidelines.

# Linked Data

## Linked Data Principles

- Use Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) as names for things
- Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.
- When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (e.g. RDF, RDFS, SPARQL, etc.)
- Include links to other URIs so that they can discover more things.

# The Semantic Web or _the Web of Data_

The Semantic Web is an extension of the World Wide Web, through standards, to make it machine-readable.

![center width:530px](https://julsraemy.ch/prezi/assets/tweaked-semweb-layer-cake.webp)

Tweaked Semantic Web Layer Cake [Idehen 2017]

<!-- This Web, which has claimed to be a Semantic Web for several years now, has a centrepiece known as Resource Description Framework (RDF), a general method for describing and exchanging graph data. The Semantic Web offers major opportunities for scholarship as it allows data to be reasoned together, that is to be understood by machines via those RDF-based ontologies, a formal way to represent human-like knowledge.  -->

---


#  Resource Description Framework (RDF)

With RDF, everything goes in threes. Most of the triples' components have Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). Syntax: **subject, predicate, object** $(s \ \vec{p} \ o)$ 

![center width:590px](https://julsraemy.ch/prezi/assets/rdf-graph.svg)


<!-- With RDF, everything goes in threes, the data model contains so-called triples: that is subject, predicate, object that form graphs.
Most of the components of these triples use Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) and are generally web-addressable, whether for naming subjects and objects (which may themselves also be objects of other triples) or relationships

# Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD)

## LOUD


- The term was coined by Robert Sanderson who has been involved in the conception and maintenance of web standards, mainly in the cultural heritage field. 
- LOUD's goal is to achieve the Semantic Web's intent on a global scale in a usable fashion by leveraging community-driven and JSON-LD-based specifications.
- It has five main design principles to make the data more easily accessible to software developers, who play a key role in interacting with the data and building software and services on top of it, and to some extent to academics. 

---

# Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD)

## LOUD design principles

- The right Abstraction for the audience
- Few Barriers to entry
- Comprehensible by introspection
- Documentation with working examples
- Few Exceptions, instead many consistent patterns

# LOUD Standards

## Specifications that follow the LOUD principles:

- International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)
- W3C Web Annotation Data Model
- Linked Art

![center bg width:45% opacity:.1](https://julsraemy.ch/prezi/assets/IIIF-logo-500w.png)

# International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) 

## IIIF

- A model for presenting and annotating content
- A global community that develops shared application programming interfaces (APIs), implements them in software, and exposes interoperable content

https://iiif.io

<!-- IIIF is a community-driven initiative, which brings together key players in the academic and CH fields, and has defined open and shared APIs to standardise the way in which image-based resources are delivered on the Web. Implementing the IIIF APIs enables institutions to make better use of their digitised or born-digital material by providing, for instance, deep zooming, comparison, full-text search of OCR objects or annotation capabilities.  -->

## <!-- fit --> Images are fundamental carriers of information

<!-- So why do we need IIIF? Digital images are fundamental carriers of information across the fields of cultural heritage, STEM, and others. They help us understand complex processes through visualization. They grab our attention and help us quickly understand abstract concepts. They help document many the past--and the  present--and preserve it for the future. They are also ubiquitous: we interact with thousands of them every day both in real life and on the web. In short, images are important and we interact with large volumes of them online.

[Felsing et al. 2023]

---

# Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD)

## LOUD in a nutshell

- Grassroots development of IIIF and Linked Art with collaboration and transparency are one of the key factors, but implementations are needed to be conducted in parallel (specifications versus demonstrability).
- LOUD standards, when used in conjunction, enhances semantic interoperability, even if it comes at the cost of ontological purity.
- LOUD practices and standards should serve as common denominators for cultural heritage institutions, public bodies as well as research projects.

# Exercise $II$ – Comparing Open Data Portals

## Short comparative analysis of open data portals

 In pairs or small groups, you will conduct a comparative analysis of one ORD portal and one OGD portal, neither of which has been previously discussed in our course. Your analysis will involve comparing these portals with similar ones that have already been presented, based on specific criteria.

1. Choose one ORD portal and one OGD portal now. Announce your chosen portals to ensure no overlap.
2. Dimensions to conduct the analysis: Launch Year, Purpose and Theme, Data Types, Access, Metadata Standards, Dataset Identifiers
3. Prepare a concise 5-minute presentation of your findings (with or without visual aids)

# _A multitude of tools_

![](https://youtu.be/pOX9CrvAG7I)

> For a better understanding of the past,
Our images have to be enhanced,
A new dialogue in three dimensions,
Must have openness at its heart,
For somewhere within the archive
Of our aggregated minds
Are a multitude of questions
And a multitude of answers,
Simply awaiting to be found.

[Mr Gee 2023], Data Poet at EuropeanaTech 2023
