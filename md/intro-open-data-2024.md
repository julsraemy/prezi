# Characteristics of Open Data

- Definitions
- Typology
- Purposes
- Requirements
- Licences
- Technical means

---

# Definitions

## Open(ness)

> Open means anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share for any purpose (subject, at most, to requirements that preserve provenance and openness)

The Open Definition according to Open Knowledge: https://opendefinition.org/

---

# Definitions

## Open(ness)

- No limitations on access of any kind
- No cost, no authentication, no national or institutional privileges

&rarr; Knowledge funded by (i.e. produced under a mandate from) the public must benefit the public without any limitations

# Definitions

## Data

> Data at its most basic level as the absence of uniformity, whether in the real world or in some symbolic system. Only once such data have some recognisable structure and are given some meaning can they be considered information.

[Floridi 2010]


---

# Definitions

## Metadata

> Data whose purpose is to describe and give information about other data.

[Oxford English Dictionary 2023]

### (Meta)data: semantic transposition

> (...) there is no fixed boundary between “data” and “metadata”, and that information viewed as data in one discipline may be metadata in another.  

[Alter et al. 2023]


---

# Definitions

## Open Data

> Open data and content can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose.

The Open Definition according to Open Knowledge: https://opendefinition.org/

# Open Research Data (ORD)

> Research data are the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital, or physical). These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Data may be raw or primary (e.g. direct from measurement or collection) or derived from primary data for subsequent analysis or interpretation (e.g. cleaned up or as an extract from a larger data set), or derived from existing sources where the rights may be held by others. 

[Concordat Working Group 2016]

---

# ORD

## For funding agencies (and institutions)

3. For the purposes of research assessment, consider the value and impact of all research outputs (**including datasets** and software) in addition to research publications, and consider a broad range of impact measures including qualitative indicators of research impact, such as influence on policy and practice.

## For organizations that supply metrics

11. Be open and transparent by providing data and methods used to calculate all metrics.
12. Provide the data under a licence that allows unrestricted reuse, and provide computational access to data, where possible.

San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA): https://sfdora.org/read/

---

# ORD in Switzerland

## SNSF Policy

The Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) expects all its funded researchers:

- to store the research data they have worked on and produced during the course of their research work,
- to share these data with other researchers, unless they are bound by legal, ethical, copyright, confidentiality or other clauses, and
- to deposit their data and metadata onto existing public repositories in formats that anyone can find, access and reuse without restriction.

https://www.snf.ch/en/dMILj9t4LNk8NwyR/topic/open-research-data

---

# Open Government Data (OGD)

> The work of government involves collecting huge amounts of data, much of which is not confidential (economic data, demographic data, spending data, crime data, transport data, etc). The value of much of this data can be greatly enhanced by releasing it as open data, freeing it for re-use by business, research, civil society, data journalists, etc.

---

# Requirements

## Two main components

1. **Legally open**: available under an open (data) license that permits anyone freely to access, reuse and redistribute
2. **Technically open**: data is available for no more than the cost of reproduction and in machine-readable and bulk form.

Open Data Handbook [Open Knowledge 2016] 
https://opendatahandbook.org/glossary/en/terms/open-data/

# Licences 

## Copyright and Copyleft

### Copyright
- Grants creators exclusive rights to control use, reproduction, and distribution.
- Designed to protect creators' economic interests; allows monetization of work.

### Copyleft
- Allows use, modification, and distribution with the condition of keeping works and derivatives open.
- Promotes freedom, sharing of knowledge, and collaborative improvement.

<!-- 
Ownership and Control:

Copyright grants the creator exclusive rights over their work, including the right to control how it's used, reproduced, and distributed. Others must obtain permission from the copyright holder to use the work, often requiring payment or adherence to specific conditions.
Copyleft, on the other hand, is a concept in the realm of free and open-source software. It allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute the work, but with the stipulation that any derivative work must also be distributed under the same or compatible license terms. This ensures that the work and its derivatives remain free and open.
Purpose and Philosophy:

Copyright is designed to protect the economic interests of creators by granting them exclusive rights to monetize their work. It supports the traditional model of intellectual property rights.
Copyleft is motivated by the idea of promoting freedom and sharing of knowledge. It is intended to keep creative works accessible and reusable for the public, encouraging collaborative improvement and innovation.

 -->

# Licences

## Anglo-Saxon Copyright vs. European Author's Rights

### Anglo-Saxon Copyright
- Focuses on economic rights; treats copyright as transferable property.
- Duration based on set years post-creation or author's life plus years.

### European Author's Rights (_droit d'auteur / Urheberrecht_)
- Emphasises moral rights alongside economic rights.
- Grants inalienable moral rights to creators; duration includes lifetime plus post-death period (commonly 70 years).

<!-- 
Focus and Foundation:

The Anglo-Saxon copyright system (common in countries like the U.S. and the U.K.) is largely focused on the economic rights of authors. It treats copyright as a type of property that can be bought, sold, or transferred, and emphasizes the monetary value of creative works.
The European author's rights model places a stronger emphasis on the moral rights of the creator, alongside the economic rights. This includes the right to be recognized as the author of a work and to object to any distortion or modification that could harm the author's reputation.
Duration and Transferability:

In the Anglo-Saxon system, copyright is often seen as a more transferable and commercial asset. The duration of copyright is typically based on a set number of years post-creation or the author's life plus a certain number of years.
The European model tends to grant authors inalienable moral rights that remain with the creator regardless of the economic rights being sold or transferred. The duration can also vary, but it usually includes the author's lifetime plus a period after their death (commonly 70 years in many European countries).

---

# Open Science

> Open Science is the practice of science in such a way that others can collaborate and contribute, where research data, lab notes and other research processes are freely available, under terms that enable reuse, redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data and methods.

[FOSTER 2019]

---

# FAIR 

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/FAIR_data_principles.jpg)

FAIR Data Principles: https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/

[Wilkinson et al. 2016]

---

# FAIR - Findable

F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier

F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1)

F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe

F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource

---

# FAIR - Accessible

A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol

- A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable

- A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary

A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

---

# FAIR - Interoperable

I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.

I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles

I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

---

# FAIR - Reusable

R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes

- R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license

- R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance

- R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards


---

# CARE 

![center w:500px](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d3799de845604000199cd24/1567592451970-2R8XFL670QNMAGDRV7ED/Be+FAIR+and+CARE.png)

---

# Collections as Data 


Checklist [Candela et al. 2023]

---

# Linked Data

## Linked Data Principles

- Use Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) as names for things
- Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.
- When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (e.g. RDF, RDFS, SPARQL, etc.)
- Include links to other URIs so that they can discover more things.

[Berners-Lee 2006]

# The Semantic Web or _the Web of Data_

The Semantic Web is an extension of the World Wide Web, through standards, to make it machine-readable.

![center width:530px](https://julsraemy.ch/prezi/assets/tweaked-semweb-layer-cake.webp)

Tweaked Semantic Web Layer Cake [Idehen 2017]

<!-- This Web, which has claimed to be a Semantic Web for several years now, has a centrepiece known as Resource Description Framework (RDF), a general method for describing and exchanging graph data. The Semantic Web offers major opportunities for scholarship as it allows data to be reasoned together, that is to be understood by machines via those RDF-based ontologies, a formal way to represent human-like knowledge.  -->

---


#  Resource Description Framework (RDF)

With RDF, everything goes in threes. Most of the triples' components have Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). Syntax: **subject, predicate, object** $(s \ \vec{p} \ o)$ 

![center width:590px](https://julsraemy.ch/prezi/assets/rdf-graph.svg)


<!-- With RDF, everything goes in threes, the data model contains so-called triples: that is subject, predicate, object that form graphs.
Most of the components of these triples use Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) and are generally web-addressable, whether for naming subjects and objects (which may themselves also be objects of other triples) or relationships 

 -->

# Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD)

## LOUD design principles

- The right Abstraction for the audience
- Few Barriers to entry
- Comprehensible by introspection
- Documentation with working examples
- Few Exceptions, instead many consistent patterns
