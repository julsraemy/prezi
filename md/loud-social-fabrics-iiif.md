title: The LOUD Social Fabrics of IIIF
description: This presentation is an opportunity to delve into one of my research questions which is related to the practices of IIIF and Linked Art by drawing attention to the social fabrics that constitute these communities notably from the standpoint of the Actor-Network Theory (ANT), a constructivist approach widely spread in Science and Technology Studies (STS) which should help me to better comprehend the roles and relationships of all actors in the implementation of LOUD standards within the cultural heritage domain and more broadly across the Digital Humanities. It was presented at the 2023 IIIF Conference in Naples on 8 June 2023.

## Linked Open Usable Data for Cultural Heritage
##### Perspectives on Community Practices and Semantic Interoperability

PhD Thesis - https://phd.julsraemy.ch - supervised by: 
- Peter Fornaro (University of Basel)
- Walter Leimgruber (University of Basel)
- Robert Sanderson (Yale University)

<!-- I am doing my PhD in Digital Humanities on Linked Open Usable Data, with a focus on its (potential) use in the Humanities and the perspectives it could bring in terms of semantics and interoperability. My research is grounded as part of the Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA) research project, which aims to develop a Citizen Science platform around three photographic collections of the Swiss Society for Folklore Studies (SSFS).  -->

### PhD Methodology (some of it)

- **Situating Linked Open Usable Data**
    - Systematic Literature Review
    - Interviews
- **The Social Fabrics of IIIF and Linked Art** 
    - Analysing "primary" data (GitHub issues, call minutes)
    - Observations
    - Survey

<!-- 

Some of the methods that I leverage for my PhD thesis...


Linked Art is an RDF application of the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model using JSON-LD and the Getty vocabularies to describe cultural heritage objects and it's also a dedicated community.

-->

---

### Surveys

- IIIF-C Investigations → _rather from an organisational standpoint_
    - 2017 IIIF Basic and Extended Adopters Surveys
    - 2020 and 2023 IIIF Implementation Surveys

- My own investigation → _rather at an individual level_
    - 2023 Survey on characterising the IIIF and Linked Art communities

 <!-- macro/micro-level: not in my garden!  -->

### Actor-Network Theory (ANT)

> *Actor-Network Theory aims at describing the very nature of societies. But to do so it does not limit itself to human individual actors, but extent the word actor - or actant - to non-human, non-individual entities.* [Latour 1996](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40878163)

1. Non-Humans Have Agency → _more open stories to be told_
2. Assembling the Collective → _intermediaries/mediators, dependencies/controversies_
3. Translation Process → _naming the associations_

<!-- "Through and beyond an ANT lens" - ANT is the foundation of the theoretical framework of my PhD thesis. 

A three step-process: 

Recognising that non-Humans have agency: this
principle allowed for more open stories to be told

Assembling the Collective: the collective can be degined as an expansion of nature and society. To assemble this, we need to unfold the Differing Cosmos of Actors, for example by mapping what Latour called "dependencies" and finding out the "controversies" in a given network full of intermediaries and mediators. Mediators are those that generate traceable associations.

Translation process: naming those associations. A Relation or association in ANT does not transport causality but induces two mediators into coexisting

## Practices

- Asking the IIIF community or other participants often goes hand in hand with using the IIIF Slack for help and discussion.
- Consulting the IIIF website and referring to documentation, GitHub or specific tools are common practices.
- Collaborating with experts within their organisation is often mentioned alongside seeking help from developers.
- Reaching out to regional or local IIIF communities/events sometimes complements other practices.2 


<!-- 

Participants frequently uses a combination of tools, such as image viewers (Mirador, UV), validators, documentation resources, and community platforms (Slack, GitHub). The IIIF specifications website, IIIF Awesome, and various training materials were also mentioned as valuable resources. The range of tools and services mentioned reflects the diverse needs and interests of the IIIF community, supporting collaboration, research, and implementation of IIIF specifications.

## Enablers

:white_check_mark: Inclusive and collaborative nature
:white_check_mark: Interoperable APIs and compatible implementations
:white_check_mark: Openness and friendliness
:white_check_mark: Commitment to providing resources and addressing needs

<!-- 

- The IIIF community's success stems from its inclusive and collaborative nature, the availability of interoperable APIs and compatible implementations, its openness and friendliness, and its commitment to providing resources and addressing specific needs.
- participants praised the IIIF community for its welcoming and generous attitude, successful implementation of the standard, and effective management structure.

## Inhibitors

:no_entry: Time constraints for participants
:no_entry: Technical complexity and learning curve
:no_entry: High costs of in-person meetings
:no_entry: Lack of employer support and recognition of community work


<!-- 

Time constraints emerged as the primary barrier, with some participants (11) expressing a lack of time to engage more actively. The technical nature of IIIF was also mentioned as a barrier, with some individuals finding it challenging to grasp the terminology and complexities quickly. Limited technical knowledge and the steep learning curve were cited as additional obstacles to entry (6). Some participants highlighted the importance of in-person meetings for community building and specification development but noted the high costs associated with organising and attending such events (2). Lack of support from employers beyond a certain point and the perception of community work as separate from job responsibilities were mentioned as barriers to deeper involvement (3).

Suggestions for improvement included better communication, emphasis on accessibility, and simpler implementation methods.
- Multiple dependencies

<!-- 

Based on the responses from 52 participants, it is evident that IIIF is recognised as a valuable tool in various contexts. A majority of participants (33) agree or strongly agree that IIIF is essential to Open Science, helps with Citizen Science initiatives (39), and contributes to the findability (45), accessibility (37), and reusability (47) aspects of the FAIR
principles. While the number of participants is significant, further exploration is needed to fully understand the extent of IIIF’s alignment with the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance

Pinning down the (LOUD) social fabrics of IIIF in relation to the Strategic Planning

## Advocacy & Leadership

- sdsdf

## Technical Development

- Maintaining widely used IIIF-compliant viewers (Mirador, UV) is crucial for the success of the IIIF Community. 

---

## Community Development

- The IIIF community is growing and evolving with new members joining regularly, while some long-standing members remain involved. However, newer individuals who joined in the past four to five years are not actively participating, particularly in TSGs. 

## Membership & Value
