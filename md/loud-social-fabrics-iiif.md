title: The LOUD Social Fabrics of IIIF
description: This presentation is an opportunity to delve into one of my research questions which is related to the practices of IIIF and Linked Art by drawing attention to the social fabrics that constitute these communities notably from the standpoint of the Actor-Network Theory (ANT), a constructivist approach widely spread in Science and Technology Studies (STS) which should help me to better comprehend the roles and relationships of all actors in the implementation of LOUD standards within the cultural heritage domain and more broadly across the Digital Humanities. It was presented at the 2023 IIIF Conference in Naples on 8 June 2023.

## Linked Open Usable Data for Cultural Heritage
##### Perspectives on Community Practices and Semantic Interoperability

PhD Thesis - https://phd.julsraemy.ch - supervised by: 
- Peter Fornaro (University of Basel)
- Walter Leimgruber (University of Basel)
- Robert Sanderson (Yale University)

<!-- I am doing my PhD in Digital Humanities on Linked Open Usable Data, with a focus on its (potential) use in the Humanities and the perspectives it could bring in terms of semantics and interoperability. My research is grounded as part of the Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA) research project, which aims to develop a Citizen Science platform around three photographic collections of the Swiss Society for Folklore Studies (SSFS).  -->


--- 

## PhD Methodology (some of it)

- **Situating Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD)**
    - Systematic Literature Review
    - Interviews
- **The Social Fabrics of IIIF and Linked Art** 
    - Analysing "primary" data (GitHub issues and call minutes)
    - Observations
    - Survey

---

## Surveys

- IIIF-C Investigations → _rather from an organisational standpoint_
    - 2017 IIIF Basic and Extended Adopters Surveys
    - 2020 and 2023 IIIF Implementation Surveys

- My own investigation → _rather at an individual level_
    - 2023 Survey on characterising the IIIF and Linked Art communities

## Actor-Network Theory (ANT)

> *Actor-Network Theory aims at describing the very nature of societies. But to do so it does not limit itself to human individual actors, but extent the word actor - or actant - to non-human, non-individual entities.* [Latour 1996](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40878163)

1. Non-Humans Have Agency → _more open stories to be told_
2. Assembling the Collective → _intermediaries/mediators, dependencies/controversies_
3. Translation Process → _naming the associations_

<!-- "Through and beyond an ANT lens" - ANT is the foundation of the theoretical framework of my PhD thesis. 

A three step-process: 

Recognising that non-Humans have agency: this
principle allowed for more open stories to be told

Assembling the Collective: the collective can be degined as an expansion of nature and society. To assemble this, we need to unfold the Differing Cosmos of Actors, for example by mapping what Latour called "dependencies" and finding out the "controversies" in a given network full of intermediaries and mediators. Mediators are those that generate traceable associations.

Translation process: naming those associations. A Relation or association in ANT does not transport causality but induces two mediators into coexisting

## Survey

_Characterising the IIIF and Linked Art communities_

:hourglass: 24 March to 7 May 2023
:eight: Sections
:computer: Google Forms
:mega: Google Groups (IIIF-Discuss and Linked Art), Slack workspaces, Mailing lists (EuropeanaTech, Humanistica, Swisslib), Mastodon

---

## Some key results

:busts_in_silhouette: 79 participants from 20 countries
:hammer_and_pick: 52 individuals involved in IIIF or in both communities
:memo: Survey report soon to be published

---

## Across actor-networks

Something about IIIF Practice, Enablers, Inhibitors

---

## Practices

<!-- 
- Asking the IIIF community or other participants often goes hand in hand with using the IIIF Slack for help and discussion.
- Consulting IIIF websites and referring to documentation, GitHub or specific tools are common practices.
- Collaborating with experts within their organisation is often mentioned alongside seeking help from developers.
- Reaching out to regional or local IIIF communities/events sometimes complements other practices.

-->

## Enablers and Inhibitors

<!-- 

- The IIIF community's success stems from its inclusive and collaborative nature, the availability of interoperable APIs and compatible implementations, its openness and friendliness, and its commitment to providing resources and addressing specific needs.
- Time constraints emerged as the primary barrier, with some participants (11) expressing a lack of time to engage more actively. The technical nature of IIIF was also mentioned as a barrier, with some individuals finding it challenging to grasp the terminology and complexities quickly. Limited technical knowledge and the steep learning curve were cited as additional obstacles to entry (6). Some participants highlighted the importance of in-person meetings for community building and specification development but noted the high costs associated with organising and attending such events (2). Lack of support from employers beyond a certain point and the perception of community work as separate from job responsibilities were mentioned as barriers to deeper involvement (3).
- participants praised the IIIF community for its welcoming and generous attitude, successful implementation of the standard, and effective management structure. Suggestions for improvement included better communication, emphasis on accessibility, and simpler implementation methods.
- Multiple dependencies

## Movements and principles


<!-- 

Based on the responses from 52 participants, it is evident that IIIF is recognised as a valuable tool in various contexts. A majority of participants (33) agree or strongly agree that IIIF is essential to Open Science, helps with Citizen Science initiatives (39), and contributes to the findability (45), accessibility (37), and reusability (47) aspects of the FAIR
principles. While the number of participants is significant, further exploration is needed to fully understand the extent of IIIF’s alignment with the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance
