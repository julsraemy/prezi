<!-- PIA is a Sinergia project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) led by the University of Basel, the Uni, the Bern Academy of the Arts, and the Swiss Society for Folklore Studies. PIA wants to connect the world of data and things in an interdisciplinary manner. 

We explore the phases of the analogue and digital archive from the perspectives of cultural anthropology, technology and design. The common goal of this project is to design a visual interface with machine learning-based tools to make it easy to annotate, contextualize, organize, and link both images and their meta-information, to deliberately encourage the participatory use of archives. -->

<!-- IIIF Workflow within PIA - We have developed an application for IIIF Resources based on Laravel, an opensource PHP Framework11 for generating IIIF resources (Manifests and Collections) as well as machine-learning Annotations, which are derived from vitrivr, a content-based multimedia retrieval system. To serve IIIF manifests, the
application consumes metadata from our repositories.
Our main database is managed through Omeka S -->

<!-- For object comparison, displaying annotations, as well as manipulating images, we decided to opt for Mirador. New cookbook recipes will be integrated into PIA, such as relevant patterns facilitating the display of geographical metadata within or pointing to maps. This monitoring work is indeed simplified as one of us is a member of the IIIF TRC, but a more automated setting without necessarily going through each recipe or the viewer matrix should in our opinion be sought -->
