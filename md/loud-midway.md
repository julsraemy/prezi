<!-- IIIF Community Overview: IIIF is a community-driven effort which is sometimes rather confusing to grasp quickly given the number of different committees, groups and denominations involved.

I have tried to provide an overview of the different actors showing the relationships and sometimes the deliverables. -->

# <!-- fit --> Theoretical Framework
### Through and beyond an Actor-Network Theory (ANT) Lens

# Theoretical Framework

Sections of the chapter:

- Implosion of the Boundaries: Objects have Agency
- Assembling the Collective
- The Translation Process

_→ The goal is to look and discuss all findings with an ANT-like lens_

<!-- 

1) Demonstrating how non-human entities have agency.; 
2) Identifying the human and non-human actors participating in the process;
3) Investigating how the concept of translation is carried out, i.e. the process that allows a network to be represented by a single entity.

-->

###  Actor-Network Theory (Latour, Akrich, Callon, Law)

> *Actor-Network Theory (ANT) aims at describing the very nature of societies. But to do so it does not limit itself to human individual actors, but extent the word actor - or actant - to non-human, non-individual entities* 

[Latour 1996](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40878163)

---

###  Situated Knowledges (Haraway)

> *Situated knowledges are about communities, not about isolated individuals. The only way to find a larger vision is to be somewhere in particular. The science question in feminism is about objectivity as positioned rationality. Its images are not the products of escape and transcendence of limits (the view from above) but the joining of partial views and halting voices into a collective subject position that promises a vision of the means of ongoing finite embodiment, of living within limits and contradictions-of views from somewhere.*

[Haraway 1998](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3178066)

---

###  Boundary Objects (Star & Griesemer)

> *Objects which are both plastic enough to adapt to local needs and constraints of the several parties employing them, yet robust enough to maintain a common identity across sites. They are weakly structured in common use, and become strongly structured in individual-site use. They may be abstract or concrete. They have different meanings in different social worlds but their structure is common enough to more than one world to make them recognizable, a means of translation.*

[Star & Griesemer 1989](https://www.jstor.org/stable/285080)
