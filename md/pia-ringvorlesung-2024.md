# Agenda

## Interlinking Cultural Heritage Data

- Cultural Heritage Data (10')
- Interlinking Data on the Web (20')
- Linked Open Usable Data (30')
- Conclusion (15')
- Discussion (15')

<!-- 

I'm first going to talk about the ways that data can be interlinked on the web in terms of vision and standards, then I will deconstruct a little bit the definition of what is cultural heritage data with a few examples and finally talk about two communities active in the cultural heritage field that develop and maintain specifications, that goes often hand in hand with the Open Science, Open Access movement.

## Cultural Heritage Data

- Defining Cultural Heritage Data
    - Heterogeneity
    - Knowledge Latency
    - Custodianship
- *Parts of a Body House*

<!-- 

From data to cultural heritage data. And I will divide this section into three parts, three keywords.

 -->

<!-- footer: Cultural Heritage Data -->


# $I$ — Defining Cultural Heritage Data


## Heterogeneity 

1. Cultural heritage data refer to digital or data-driven affordances of cultural heritage, embodying **a rich and varied compilation of insights  originating from a variety of disciplines, techniques, traditions, positions and technologies**. It encompasses both tangible and intangible aspects of a society's culture as well as natural heritage. 


Cultural Heritage encompassing tangible, intangible as well as natural dimensions: Cf. UNESCO. Culture for Development Indicators [2014]

<!--  

As a fundamental characteristic, heterogeneity signifies the diverse forms and origins that shape heritage. E.g. Different techniques and varying viewpoints in treating data modelling.

-->

---

# $II$ — Defining Cultural Heritage Data

## Knowledge Latency

2.  These data, derived from a wide range of disciplines, offer **a latent capacity to support the generation of knowledge** relating to historical time periods, geospatial areas, as well as current and past human and nonhuman activities. 

<!-- 

Every dataset embodies an underlying potential that research and interpretation bring to light. A noticeable divide, especially within cultural heritage, exists between the generation of data, description of it and its use, owing to the diverse array of unforeseen applications.

This second characteristic also highlights the temporal dimension, presenting cultural heritage data as a repository of latent knowledge awaiting discovery and interpretation. Notably, not all artefacts are – or should be – digitised, and even among those that are, (mis)representation and challenges in interconnecting them persist.

-->

---


# $III$ — Defining Cultural Heritage Data

## Custodianship 

3. They are collected, curated and maintained **by various entities** such as libraries, archives, museums, higher education institutions, non-governmental organisations, indigenous communities and local groups as well as by the wider public.

<!-- 

This dimension reinforces the essential role played by a variety of entities, predominantly CHIs, in safeguarding and managing resources, ensuring their preservation and accessibility for present and future generations. However, it's crucial to acknowledge the great divide in terms of resources, with indigenous and local communities often facing challenges in custodianship responsibilities.

# _Parts of a Body House_ by Carolee Schneemann

![center](https://artic-web.imgix.net/09fc275f-e14d-4277-af79-17f5b0dcf131/rossenova_difranco_fig01_DRAFT.jpg)

[Rossenova & Di Franco 2022]

<!-- 

Rossenova and Di Franco's article delves into artists' books, focusing on Carolee Schneeman's "Parts of a Body House." Unlike traditional art acquisitions, artists' books landed in libraries of art institutions, following the 1960s' surge in their recognition as art objects. These collections don't fit neatly into curatorial realms; instead, they're cataloged under library definitions. The challenge intensifies when materials resist categorization or adopt archival, serial, or ephemeral labels. Many artists' publications purposefully defy conventional library, archive, and collection norms.

The study uncovered linked collections and publications from Schneeman's contributions, though these distinct versions find varying categorization across institution-specific catalogs.

For unconventional art archives like artist's books, linked data's network model provides a means to chart relationships of indefinable embodied versions, constructing intricate histories beyond categorization or canonization.

However, community discussions revealed difficulty in fully describing the array of relationships across editions, reinterpretations, serializations, or appropriations of publications within the LOD model structure.

<!-- 

While the case-study research revealed the interconnections among the collections and publications activated by Schneemann’s contribution, these discrete iterations are sorted into different categories within a group of collection catalogs across institutions.

For archives of nonstandard art objects such as net art or artists’ publishing (e.g., Schneemann’s work), the network model of LOD offers an opportunity to map out relations of embodied iterations that defy categorization (or canonization) and thus construct new, fuller and more nuanced histories around these materials.

During community discussions, the sheer range of possible relations across editions, reinterpretations, serializations, or appropriations of publications proved challenging to describe completely within the structure of the LOD model.

<!-- footer: Interlinking Data on the Web -->


# An Open Vision of the Web

> The [World Wide Web] project merges the techniques of information retrieval and hypertext to make an easy but powerful global information system. The project started with **the philosophy that much academic information should be freely available to anyone**.

[Berners-Lee 1991]

# The Semantic Web or _the Web of Data_

The Semantic Web is an extension of the World Wide Web, through standards, to make it machine-readable.

![center width:530px](https://julsraemy.ch/prezi/assets/tweaked-semweb-layer-cake.webp)

Tweaked Semantic Web Layer Cake [Idehen 2017]

<!-- This Web, which has claimed to be a Semantic Web for several years now, has a centrepiece known as Resource Description Framework (RDF), a general method for describing and exchanging graph data. The Semantic Web offers major opportunities for scholarship as it allows data to be reasoned together, that is to be understood by machines via those RDF-based ontologies, a formal way to represent human-like knowledge.  -->

<!-- 5-star open data scheme 
1) make your stuff available on the Web (whatever format) under an open license
2) make it available as structured data
3) make it available in a non-proprietary open format (e.g., CSV instead of Excel
4) use URIs to denote things, so that people can point at your stuff
5) link your data to other data to provide context -->

# Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD)

## LOUD


- The term was coined by Robert Sanderson [2018, 2019] who has been involved in the conception and maintenance of web standards, mainly in the cultural heritage field.

- LOUD's goal is to achieve the Semantic Web's intent on a global scale in a usable fashion by leveraging community-driven standards (e.g. IIIF, Linked Art).

- It has five main design principles to make the data more easily accessible to software developers, who play a key role in interacting with the data and building software and services on top of it, and to some extent to academics.

# LOUD Design Principles

## Five design principles

- The right Abstraction for the audience
- Few Barriers to entry
- Comprehensible by introspection
- Documentation with working examples
- Few Exceptions, instead many consistent patterns

https://linked.art/loud/


<!-- The overall idea of LOUD is to make data easy to use for humans, especially for developers. JSON-LD allows for some mapping of ontological constructs into JSON, which is the lingua-franca of modern developers and is a cornerstone technology of LOUD. Five design principles to promote data consumption have been conceived. 
To be part of the Web, not just on the Web.  -->

## <!-- fit --> Images are fundamental carriers of information

<!-- So why do we need IIIF? Digital images are fundamental carriers of information across the fields of cultural heritage, STEM, and others. They help us understand complex processes through visualization. They grab our attention and help us quickly understand abstract concepts. They help document many the past--and the  present--and preserve it for the future. They are also ubiquitous: we interact with thousands of them every day both in real life and on the web. In short, images are important and we interact with large volumes of them online.

# LOUD Standards

### IIIF

* IIIF facilitates the sharing of high-resolution image-based content through a series of specifications. It also makes use of some resource types defined by the Web Annotation Data Model. Semantic metadata can be linked from IIIF resources via `seeAlso`.

### Web Annotation Data Model

* The Web Annotation Data Model provides a standard for creating and sharing annotations across various platforms.

###  Linked Art

* Linked Art provides a model and an API for semantically describing cultural heritage. With this specification, it is possible as well to describe web services such as IIIF.

<!-- 

LOUX integrates technologies, mostly community-driven, like IIIF, WADM, and Linked Art. Together, they demonstrate a transformative potential in how cultural heritage data is interacted with and understood, reshaping traditional humanities and opening new research opportunities.

## IIIF

- A model for presenting and annotating content
- A global community that develops shared application programming interfaces (APIs), implements them in software, and exposes interoperable content

https://iiif.io


<!-- IIIF is a community-driven initiative, which brings together key players in the academic and CH fields, and has defined open and shared APIs to standardise the way in which image-based resources are delivered on the Web. Implementing the IIIF APIs enables institutions to make better use of their digitised or born-digital material by providing, for instance, deep zooming, comparison, full-text search of OCR objects or annotation capabilities.  -->

# Linked Art Community Call

![bg 61%](https://julsraemy.ch/prezi/assets/attendance_stacked_bar_la.svg)

<!-- 

This bar plot provides a snapshot of the Linked Art meetings from January 2019 to March 2024. The group convenes fortnightly to deliberate on refining the model and the API. It indicates participation trends over this period, showing that 130 different individuals attended the 115 meetings held, predominantly in a virtual format, with five of these meetings being face-to-face. Each participant attended an average of 13.57 of sessions, but the median attendance was only 2, indicating a very long tail of participation. This suggests a core group of highly engaged members who contribute consistently, while a larger number of participants engage more sporadically.

# LOUD-driven Communities

## IIIF and Linked Art: social fabrics of sound socio-technical practices

- Synergy of effective social and technical integration with an emphasis on usability
- Unified by shared expertise and leadership
- Collaboration beyond technical boundaries
- Inclusivity and diversity in participation
- Openness and friendliness as core values
- Commitment to transparency
- Organisation of online and face-to-face meetings

[Raemy 2023]

<!-- 
Socio-technical aspects

Emphasis on Usable Linked Data: Both IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) and Linked Art communities prioritize creating and using data that is interconnected, user-friendly, and easily accessible.

Shared Leadership and Expertise: Key individuals play pivotal roles across both initiatives, bringing a wealth of shared knowledge and leadership.

Joint Standards and Development Efforts: Collaboration is a cornerstone in these communities, evident in their joint efforts in standardizing, developing, and organizing meetings. This fosters a strong culture of community-led initiatives and collective wisdom.

Inclusivity and Collaboration at Core: Both communities are known for their inclusive approach, welcoming contributions and ideas from diverse backgrounds and expertise.

Openness and Friendliness as Guiding Principles: A welcoming atmosphere and an open-door policy characterize both IIIF and Linked Art, encouraging participation and innovation.

Commitment to Transparency: Transparency is key in all their operations, from decision-making to development processes, ensuring that all actions are clear and accountable to the community.

## Conclusion

<!-- footer: Conclusion -->

# Infrastructure [Star 1999]

> People commonly envision infrastructure as a system of substrates – railroad, lines, pipes and plumbing, electrical power plants, and wires. **It is by definition invisible, part of the background for other kinds of work**. It is ready-to-hand. This image holds up well enough for many purposes – turn on the faucet for a drink of water and you use a vast infrastructure of plumbing and water regulation without usually thinking much about it.

## Dimensions

Embeddedness, transparency, reach or scope, learned as part of membership, links with conventions of practice, embodiment of standards, built on an installed base, becomes visible upon breakdown, is fixed in modular increments, not all at once globally

<!-- 

Thee of the nine dimensions...

Embeddedness: Infrastructure is sunk into and inside of other structures, social arrangements, and technologies. People do not necessarily distinguish the several coordinated aspects of infrastructure.

Links with conventions of practice: Infrastructure both shapes and is shaped by the conventions of a community of practice.

Embodiment of standards: Modified by scope and often by conflicting conventions, infrastructure takes on transparency by plugging into other infrastructures and tools in a standardised fashion.

# LOUD-Driven Infrastructure

![center w:1000](https://julsraemy.ch/prezi/assets/loud-infra-example.jpg)

[Felsing et al. 2023]

# Conclusion

## LOUD in a nutshell

* Grassroots development of IIIF and Linked Art with collaboration and transparency are one of the key factors, but implementations are needed to be conducted in parallel (specifications versus demonstrability).

* LOUD standards, when used in conjunction, enhances semantic interoperability, even if it comes at the cost of ontological purity.

* LOUD practices and standards should serve as common denominators for cultural heritage institutions, public bodies as well as research projects.

<!-- 

An important proposition arises from the observation that adherence to the \ac{LOUD} design principles makes specifications more likely to be adopted. The primary benefit of adopting \ac{LOUD} standards lies in their grassroots nature. The development and maintenance of \ac{LOUD} standards by dedicated communities are characterised by collaboration, consensus building, and transparency. This grassroots approach not only aligns with the core values of openness and collaboration within the \ac{DH} community but also serves as a common denominator between \ac{DH} practitioners and \acp{CHI}. This unique alignment fosters a sense of shared purpose and common ground. However, it's essential to acknowledge that while \ac{LOUD} and its associated standards, including IIIF, hold immense promise, their limited recognition in the wider socio-technical ecosystem may currently hinder their full potential impact.

-->

# Conclusion

## LOUD within PIA


* Leveraging software developed by the wider IIIF community, alongside adopting best practices from Linked Art.

* Benefiting from cross-interoperability capabilities.

* Engaging public contributions and enriching narratives through crowdsourcing and storytelling approaches.

* Creating opportunities to meet and collaborate.

# Discussion

## Interlinking Cultural Heritage Data with Community-driven Principles and Standards

- Can LOUD practices and standards serve as unifying elements across diverse cultural heritage data? What are their limitations?

- What strategies should be essential for developing a common data space in the cultural heritage field?

- How does the technical complexity of these integrations affect the required expertise?

- In terms of digital temporality, how can we balance qualitative insights with quantitative data to enrich our understanding of cultural heritage?
